# This is me learning Markdown

## You use 2 "##" to make subsections, and one "#" to make headers

This is some normal text and stuff

## Text Formatting
Much like discord, you surround text in * to make special things happen for many formats. **two * is bold**  
*one * is italics*

`print("Hello World")`
